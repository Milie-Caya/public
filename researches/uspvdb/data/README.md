# Data Folder README

This folder contains several key data files for the research project. These files are provided in multiple formats to facilitate different types of analyses and applications. Below is a description of each file and its format.

## File Descriptions

### 1. `uspvdbGeoJSON.zip`
- **Format:** GeoJSON
- **Description:** This file contains spatial data in the GeoJSON format, a popular format for encoding a variety of geographic data structures. GeoJSON is often used for web-based mapping applications and can be easily integrated with many GIS software and services.

### 2. `uspvdbCSV.zip`
- **Format:** CSV (Comma-Separated Values)
- **Description:** This CSV file provides the data in a simple, tabular format. CSV files are universally compatible with numerous data analysis tools and software, making it a versatile choice for data manipulation and basic analysis.
