# Metrics

Let's break down each tool and provide an overview of how they could be implemented:

### 1. Panel-to-Capacity Conversion Tool

This tool can be implemented as a simple function that takes the number of solar panels as input and outputs the total capacity in megawatts.

```python
def panel_to_capacity(number_of_panels):
    return number_of_panels / 5000
```

### 2. Capacity-to-Area Estimation Tool

This requires determining the average area required per MW from your database. Once you have this average, the tool is a straightforward calculation.

```python
average_area_per_mw = # (value derived from your database)

def capacity_to_area(capacity_mw):
    return capacity_mw * average_area_per_mw
```

### 3. Operational Year Analysis Tool

To create a histogram or timeline, you'd first need to extract the operational year data from your database. Then, you can use a visualization library like Matplotlib or Plotly in Python to create the histogram.

```python
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

# Assuming 'operational_year' is a column in your dataframe
def operational_year_histogram(dataframe):
    dataframe['operational_year'].hist()
    plt.title('Distribution of Solar Facilities by Operational Year')
    plt.xlabel('Year')
    plt.ylabel('Number of Facilities')
    plt.show()
```

### 4. Capacity Distribution Analysis Tool

Similar to the operational year tool, you would use the capacity data from your dataset to create a histogram or bar chart.

```python
def capacity_distribution_histogram(dataframe):
    dataframe['capacity_mw'].hist(bins=20) # Adjust the number of bins as needed
    plt.title('Distribution of Facilities by Capacity')
    plt.xlabel('Capacity (MW)')
    plt.ylabel('Number of Facilities')
    plt.show()
```

### 5. Geographical Heatmap Tool

For the heatmap, you'd use latitude and longitude data. Libraries like Folium or Plotly can be used for creating interactive maps.

```python
import folium
from folium.plugins import HeatMap

def create_heatmap(dataframe):
    m = folium.Map(location=[average_latitude, average_longitude], zoom_start=6)
    HeatMap(dataframe[['latitude', 'longitude']].values.tolist()).add_to(m)
    return m
```

### 6. Facility Type Distribution Tool

This tool would use a pie or bar chart to show the distribution of different facility types.

```python
def facility_type_distribution(dataframe):
    dataframe['facility_type'].value_counts().plot(kind='pie')
    plt.title('Distribution of Facility Types')
    plt.show()
```

### Implementing the Dashboard

To combine these tools into a dashboard, you would use a framework like Dash or Streamlit in Python. These frameworks allow you to create web-based applications that can interactively display data and visualizations.

For a detailed implementation, you'd need to write a script that integrates these functions and visualizations into a cohesive dashboard. The script would also include the layout and interactivity elements of the dashboard.

This is a high-level overview. For a complete implementation, each of these tools needs to be tailored to the specifics of your dataset and requirements, and the dashboard needs to be set up in an environment that supports these frameworks.
